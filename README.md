# Tipsy Tastings

Tipsy Tastings is a place for users to share their cocktail creations and discover new cocktails in our cocktail database!

## Application Overview

Finding inspiration for your next cocktail creation can be difficult, especially since there are not many cocktail databases that showcase creative cocktails from different users aside from your typical classic cocktails like the moscow mule. Tipsy Tastings was designed to allow users to add their cocktail creations to a large database, but also to a smaller database that consists of only their cocktails. Just like Instagram, users will have their own page filled with pictures of their own cocktails and captions for each pictures. Other users can see these posts and create their own!

This project is my fullstack capstone, the culmination of a 6-month long intensive full-stack coding bootcamp. My goals for this capstone were to explore and get a better understanding of server side concepts by increasing its responsibility in terms of the logic that is incorporated rather than implementing that same logic on the client side. I also wanted to get a better understanding of CSS styling concepts and React regarding state. The layout I used for my website to view each of the cocktail recipes is something new and challenging I had not done before.

## Features

- Users can create/edit/delete their own cocktail creations and posts on their profile.
- Users can view cocktails created by other users and view the recipe and ingredients.
- Users can explore new cocktails either on the Cocktail Discovery page, or the main feed page where the 10 most recently added cocktails will be shown.
- Users can also filter cocktails on the Cocktail Discovery page based on the kind of liquor. If they were to select vodka, all of the vodka cocktails would appear as a result.
